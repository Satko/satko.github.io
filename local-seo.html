        <h1>Local SEO Quick Introduction</h1><br>
        <h4>What is Local Search Engine Optimization?</h4><br><br>

        <p>Local SEO is combining a set of tools, data, research and strategy to improve your online rank and
            presence, whether you are selling products or offering services and depending on your area of service.</p><br><br>

        <h2> Local Search Analytics</h2><br><br>
        <p>Understanding the intent of your target audience:
            To find out what your customers are looking for in your particular niche, then you have to
            put yourself in the same spot as them and go on Google to see what are they looking for.
            Perform a couple of searches with your product or service in mind, add a location with your
            search query, this can be your address or in a general area, like a city, county etc.
            For example, you are a new book shop owner in New York City, who would like to find out
            what are the best bookstores in NYC? Type that into the search bar and hit enter.
            Do some scouting around, open up a few Google My Business profiles as shown in the image below,
            open up some of their sites, get familiar with what your competition is doing. This will prove
            useful later, when you start doing keyword research and optimization.</p><br><br>
        <img data-src="gmb-rank-example.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Google My Business Rank"><br><br>

        <p>Next, research your keywords, you can use any keyword research tool to find out what the average
            search volume is then, make sure that you have implemented these keywords throughout your content
            and listing profile, like description and if possible, in the business name.
            Obviously, your target keywords and content should be done before setting up your website or listing
            as it will be easier to add them to your content before publishing it.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Optimizing Your Listings</h3>

        <h5>Am I Eligible For a Listing Profile?</h5><br><br>

        <div class="citation">
            <p>
            <p>Eligible businesses<br><br>

                In order to qualify for a Business Profile on Google, a business must make in-person contact with
                customers during its stated hours.

                There are some exceptions:</p><br><br>

            <p>ATMs, video-rental kiosks, and express mail dropboxes are permitted. If you add these locations,
                you must include contact information for customers to get help. Seasonal businesses, like an
                ice-skating rink only open in winter months, are eligible. These businesses must display permanent
                signage at their location year-round. Virtual Kitchens are permitted. Virtual Kitchens are
                professional food preparation and cooking facilities set up to prepare delivery-only meals via
                third-party services. They are also referred to as Ghost Kitchens and Cloud Kitchens. A Virtual
                Kitchen should create their Business Profile as a service area business.</p>

            <p>Ineligible businesses<br><br>

                The following businesses are not eligible for a business listing:</p>

            <p>Rental or for-sale properties such as vacation homes, model homes, or vacant apartments.
                Sales or leasing offices, however, are eligible for verification. An ongoing service, class,
                or meeting at a location that you don't own or have the authority to represent.
                Lead generation agents or companies.</p>

        <h3>Google, Bing or Apple? Where To Set Up My Listing?</h3><br><br>

        <p>For starters, Google is your best bet, it's the best optimized and user friendly way. And to be
            honest, Google is the biggest search engine so, that's where most of your traffic will come from.
            Once you understand the basic principles of how listings work, you can move on to Bing Places or
            Apple Maps since it's pretty much the same principles. But yeah, you can only do Google and you'll
            be good.</p><br><br>
        <img data-src="difference-gmb-bing-places.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Google My Business versus Bing Places"><br><br>


        <h3>How To Claim Your Listing?</h3><br><br>
        <img data-src="claim-gmb-google-my-business-local-seo.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Claim Google My Business Profile"><br><br>


        <p>If you are the owner of a certain physical office, store or a shop that offers services, odds are,
            your business is already on Google. Google uses its users feedback, to enable it to create business
            profiles online automatically, or, any owner of a business can go online and create it himself,
            see below. It can also use information from other sites, like Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.</p><br><br>

        <p>To find out if Google has already created a listing for your business, type your store name and
            address in the search bar, hit enter and voila! You will see a box on the right side of the search
            results page, this is called the "Knowledge Panel". If you don't see a listing profile, no cause for
            concern, you can create it yourself, which is a very simple and straightforward process and takes
            up only a few minutes to set up.</p><br><br>
        <img data-src="gmb-listing.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid center" alt="Google My Business Profile"><br><br>

        <p>First, if you have the business profile of your store open on Google, go and click on Own this
            business? link. If the listing hasn't been claimed by anyone else, then you can simply follow the
            steps and fill in your information and, in about a week(takes longer outside the US), Google will
            send you a Google My Business postcard that contains a pin number needed to verify that you are
            indeed the owner of the location, hence gain access to your Google My Business profile.</p><br><br>

        <h3>What Checks To Perform As Soon As You Have Verified Your Listing</h3><br><br>

        <p>Once you log in, you may check your information, make the necessary changes, and click on the
            update button.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Google My Business Profile:</h4>
        <img data-src="google-my-business-profile-gmb.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Verified Google My Business Profile"><br><br>
        <h4>Bing Places Profile:</h4>
        <img data-src="bing-places.webp" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" class="lazyload rounded img-fluid" alt="Inside a Bing Places Profile"><br><br>
        <p>Make sure to head into the info tab and check if your name, address, phone number and schedule
            matches your physical location. Next, when someone searches for a store or business online,
            they usually like to see photos of the location, what it looks like outside, inside, products,
            if you offer some. So, once logged in your Google My Business profile, you can go to Photos,
            and upload a few clear photos of your business, make sure your profile photo features your store
            front, add your logo and add some photos of the inside or the products that you offer.
            Once that is done, you can go ahead and update your website, if you have one, which at this point,
            I'm just going to assume you do.</p><br><br>
