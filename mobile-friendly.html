            <h1>Mobile Friendly Sites</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>In the last decade, Smartphones have changed the world and still continue to do. This had a huge effect on the Web, especially. With Smartphones 
            overtaking Personal Computers in a lot of countries all over the world. So, in 2015, Google, in order to motivate people to start developing their
            websites with mobile being the first thing to optimize for, started to reward websites that were built with Mobile Friendliness in mind.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="citation">
            <p>"On February 26, Google made an important two-part announcement on its official blog. While the overall takeaway is that Google wants websites to be 
            mobile-friendly, there are two important changes to understand:
            More mobile-friendly websites in search results.
            More relevant app content in search results.
            Now, it's important to understand that Google is not referring to desktop rankings. This announcement is in reference to mobile search rankings,
            specifically. However, there is a lot of speculation from reputable sources that mobile-friendliness will impact desktop rankings in the near future, as well.
            It's also unclear whether or not Google will be adjusting its rankings on a page-by-page or site-wide basis. This could be an important distinction 
            for websites that have separate mobile sites or versions. The safest way for site owners to ensure they're properly optimized is to pay attention to 
            all site pages.
            According to Robert Ramirez, SEO Manager at Bruce Clay, Inc., this announcement is critical for everyone and ultimately points towards the need to adopt 
            responsive design. "As Google's preferred method of serving content to mobile users, we can assume that responsive sites will be favored by Google in 
            search results going forward, and this is the first real step in that process," Ramirez said. Furthermore, he suggests that if it's not possible to make 
            your site responsive by April 21, you should--at the very least--address the deficiencies of your existing mobile solution."</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This had a huge effect on the Dev world. And today, in 2020, if your website is not optimized for Handheld devices, it may take a hit in ranking due to 
            Google enforcing these policies. Even if its ranking is not affected, it's a bad practice to have a website, no matter what it's purpose is in 2020 
            without optimizing it for Mobile devices. If you don't, you'll be missing out on a lot of benefits, like increased link authority, rank and an ever-growing customer base.
            A lot of people started to focus on how to best optimize their websites so they can be displayed right no matter what device they were viewed from, and 
            this encouraged people to build and come up with all kinds of software-based solutions with frameworks like Bootstrap, a CSS frameworks which utilizes 
            HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. Which I use on this site. 
            There also a ton of JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks that enable fast and smooth web development like Express, React, Angular, Vue and many more. 
            JavaScript is not the only language with a big focus on web development... There are also frameworks for Python, PHP, Ruby, and others. Which one you will 
            use, is up to your preferences. - Now, I don't have any experience with any of the programming language based frameworks aforementioned so, take this information 
            with a pinch of salt. I'm sure that if some experienced developers are reading this they'll be laughing. But hey, I'm open to feedback so, feel free to contact me 
            to correct the information.
            You see, all of these solutions are being made to make it easier for software and web developers, without having to set them up from zero, you should really be taking 
            advantage of them. If you are a developer that is.</p>

            <div class="citation">
            <p>"How much does it cost to build a site for mobile devices?
            It varies. For example, here are some of the possibilities:
            Going mobile can be free if you can select a responsive template or theme for your website. A responsive template or theme adapts the display to the 
            visitor no matter if they are using a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
            Going mobile can be free if you have the technical skills to build your mobile site. Check out Web Fundamentals.
            Going mobile will likely cost time and money if you need to hire a developer. Furthermore, if your website was created several years ago, a new developer 
            might recommend starting from scratch (so you'll be paying for a complete makeover). This is because there are new web development techniques 
            and themes (or page templates) that may make it more efficient to re-do -- rather than modify -- your site. This is especially the case for sites:
             -Built with Flash
             -Using outdated e-commerce platforms
            The good news is that if you start from scratch there may be an existing template or theme that you can utilize. You may be able to reuse your 
            existing content which can hopefully save time and money."</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>So, as you can see, it's not difficult to change a desktop-oriented site into a mobile-friendly one, if you can do it yourself, you should 
            do so asap. If not, you can pay a developer to that for you. The point is, your website has to be mobile-friendly as smartphones are getting 
            more accessible and people are more likely to buy one instead of buying a personal computer.
            According to Google: In the USA, 94% of people with smartphones search for local information on their phones. Interestingly, 77% of mobile 
            searches occur at home or at work, places where desktop computers are likely to be present.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>How to make your website mobile friendly?</h2>
            <p>Google offers you a simple, one-click test to check if your website is mobile friendly. It even shows you 
              what to improve in order to pass the test with 'flying colors'.<br><br>
            </p><strong><a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">Click Here.</a></strong>
            
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Making your site mobile friendly requires you to add the following meta tag to your HTML Head:<br>
            <<strong>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</strong>><br>
            What this does is, it tells the browser how to properly display all the elements present in the body of the
            website as the display size changes. This ensures that no matter what device the site is viewed on, the text
            and images will be readable and view able without the need to zoom in.
            </p>
            <h4>Optmizie your site for Mobile Devices</h4><br>
            <p>Now this is the part that actually requires a lot of work in order to get every little bit of your site
              looking beautiful and functional. I recommend that you use one of the frameworks available out there. For 
              this site, I opted with Bootstrap 4. It gives the site a whole different level of responsiveness and adds
              nice touches that takes 'mobile friendly site' up a notch. It has a lot of built in responsive design
              that you don't have to necessarily do all by hand. It saves a lot of time and while it does have a steeper
              learning curve, it does make life easier in the long run.
